        <h1>Before We Begin</h1>
        <p>
          Before we delve into code, there are a few issues we need to cover.
          Everyone's system is different and everyone has their own groove.
          Getting your first "hello world" program to compile and load correctly
          can sometimes be a trick. Rest assured, after you get over the initial
          hurdle of doing it for the first time, it will be smooth sailing from
          thereafter.
        </p>
        <li class="enumerate">
          Modversioning. A module compiled for one kernel will not load if you
          boot a different kernel unless you enable <b>CONFIG_MODVERSIONS</b> in
          the kernel. We will not go into module versioning until later. Until
          we cover modversions, the examples in the guide may not work if you
          are running a kernel with modversioning turned on. However, most stock
          Linux distrubition kernels come with it turned on. If you are having
          trouble loading modules because of versioning errors, compile a kernel
          with modversioning turned off.
        </li>
        <li class="enumerate">
          Using X Window System. It is highly recommended that you extract,
          compile and load all the examples this guide discusses from a console.
          You should not be working on this stuff in X Window System.
        </li>
        <p>
          Modules can not print the screen like <b>printf()</b> can, but they
          can log information and warnings, which ends up bring printed on your
          screen, but only on a console. If you <b>ismod</b> a module from an
          xterm, the information and warnings will be logged, but only to your
          systemd journal. You will not see it unless you look through your
          <b>journalctl</b>. To have immediate access to this information, do
          all your work through the console.
        </p>
        <li class="enumerate">
          SecureBoot. Many contemporary computers are pre-configured with UEFI
          SecureBoot enabled. It is a security standard that can make sure the
          device boots using only software that is trusted by original equipment
          manufacturer. The default Linux kernel from some distrubitions have
          also enabled SecureBoot. For such distributions, the kernel module has
          to be signed with the security key or you would get the
          <i>"ERROR: could not insert module"</i> when you insert your first
          hello world module:
          <pre
            class="language-shell"
          ><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name"></span> <span class="token assign-left variable">$</span><span class="token operator"> </span>insmod ./hello-1.ko</code></pre>
        </li>
        <p>
          And then you can check further with <b>dmesg</b> and see the following
          text:
        </p>

        <p>
          <i
            >Lockdown: insmod: unsigned module loading is restricted; see man
            kernel lockdown.7</i
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          If you got this message, the simplest way is to disable the UEFI
          SecureBoot from the PC/Laptop boot menu to have your "hello-1" to be
          inserted. Of course you can go through complicated steps to generate
          keys, install keys to your system, and finally sign your module to
          make it work. However, this is not suitable for beginners. You could
          read and follow the steps in
          <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot">SecureBoot</a> if you are
          interested.
