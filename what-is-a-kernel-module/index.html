    <section <p>So, you want to write a kernel module. You know C, you've written a few normal programs to run as
      processes, and
      now you want to get to where the real action is, to where a single wild pointer can wipe out your file system and
      a
      core dump means a reboot.

      What exactly is a kernel module? Modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon
      demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. For example, one type
      of module is the device driver, which allows the kernel to access hardware connected to the system. Without
      modules, we would have to build monolithic kernels and add new functionality directly into the kernel image.
      Besides having larger kernels, this has the disadvantage of requireing us to rebuild and reboot the kernel every
      time
      we want new functionality. </p>
    </section>
    <h1> How do modules get into the Kernel? </h1>
    <section>
      <p>You can see what modules are already loaded inth the kernel by running <b>lsmod</b>, which gets its information
        by
        reading the <tt>/proc/modules</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>How do these modules find their way into the kernel? When the kernel needs a feature that is not resident in
        the
        kernel, the kernel moduled daemon <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/kmod.8.html">kmod</a> execs
        modprobe to load the module in. modprobe is passed a string
        in one of two forms:

        <li>A module name like <tt>softdog</tt> or <tt>ppp</tt>
        <li>A more generic identifier like <tt>char-major-10-30</tt>
      </p>
      <p>If modprobe is handed a generic identifier, it first looks for that string in the file
        <tt>/etc/modprobe.conf/</tt>. If it finds an alias line like:
      </p>

      <TABLE BORDER="1" BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0" WIDTH="100%">
        <TR>
          <TD>
            <FONT COLOR="#000000">
              <PRE CLASS="SCREEN">alias char-major-10-30 softdog
              </PRE>
            </FONT>
          </TD>
        </TR>
      </TABLE>
      <p>It knows that the generic identifier refers to the module <tt class="FILENAME">softdog.ko</tt>.</p>
      <p>Next, modprobe looks through the file <tt>/lib/modules/version/modules.dep</tt>, to see if other modules must
        be loaded before the requested module may be loaded. This file is created by <b class="command">depmod -a</b>
        and contains module dependencies. For
        example, <tt class="filename">msdos.ko</tt> requries the <tt class="filename">fat.ko</tt> module to be already
        loaded into the kernel. The requested module has a dependency on another module if the other module defines
        symbols (variables or functions) that the requested module
        uses.</p>
      <p>Lastly, modprobe uses insmod to first load any prerequisite modules into the kernel, and then the requested
        module. modprobe directs insmod to <tt class="filename">/lib/modules/version</tt>, the standard directory for
        modules. insmod is intended to be
        fairly dumb about the location of modules, whereas modprobe is aware of the default location of modules, knows
        how to figure out the dependencies and load the modules in the right order. So for example, if you wanted to
        load the
        msdos module, you'd have to either run:</p>
      <TABLE BORDER="1" BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0" WIDTH="100%">
        <TR>
          <TD>
            <FONT COLOR="#000000">
              <PRE CLASS="SCREEN">insmod /lib/modules/2.6.11/kernel/fs/fat/fat.ko
insmod /lib/modules/2.6.11/kernel/fs/msdos/msdos.ko
              </PRE>
            </FONT>
          </TD>
        </TR>
      </TABLE>
      <P> or: </P>
      <TABLE BORDER="1" BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0" WIDTH="100%">
        <TR>
          <TD>
            <FONT COLOR="#000000">
              <PRE CLASS="SCREEN">modprobe msdos
              </PRE>
            </FONT>
          </TD>
        </TR>
      </TABLE>
      <p>What we've seen here is: <b>insmod</b> requires you to pass it the full pathname and to insert the modules in
        the right order, while <b>modprobe</b> just takes the name, without any extension, and figures out all it needs
        to know by parsing <tt>/lib/modules/version/modules.dep</tt>.</p>
      <p>Linux distros provide modprobe, insmod and depmod as a package called module-init-tools. In previous versions that package was called modutils. Some distros also set up some wrappers that allow both packages to be installed in
        parallel and do the right thing in order to be able to deal with 2.4 and 2.6 kernels. Users should not need to care about the details, as long as they're running recent versions of those tools.</p>
      <p>Now you know how modules get into the kernel. There's a bit more to the story if you want to write your own modules which depend on other modules (we calling this `stacking modules`). But this will have to wait for a future article.
        We have a lot to cover before addressing this relatively high-level issue.
